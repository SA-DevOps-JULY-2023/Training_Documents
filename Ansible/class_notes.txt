#######################
Day 2 - 27th July 2023 
#######################		

			DevOps is a Software Development Strategy/Process, which helps to promote collaboration with the teams like Development Team and Operations Team and automate the end-to-end Software development process.
		
			
			
			Infra-Structure Provision & Configuration :::: 
					Infra-Structure As Code - IAC Tools 	Jenkins ---> 
							Terraform		==> Provision/Create the virtual Machines/servers
							Ansible 		==> Configuration Management ==> Install/Remove/Upgrade any tools 
							
							
							
							
			Continuous Development
			
			Sofware Development :::
			
				Developers --> Coding --> Java/C#/Python/Angular/NodeJS		==> Used to Develop Business Logics.
							Eg.: www.amazon.com - E_Commerce 
						Coding	- Sign_Up_Module --> *.java (High Level Language) 
								IDEs -- Integrated Development Environment -- Eclipse - Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Pycharm, Intellj
								Code the application and save it in a source code repository(GIT) Jenkins
								
						Application build 	--> It is a process of compiling the source code and creating artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec)
										Build Tools ---> Maven/Gradle/Ant --> Jenkins
						Perform Unit Testing  --> Automate Unit Testing (Using Maven Integration) Jenkins 
						Promote the application for further testing (QA/UAT-Envi.) - Jenkins
						Notify the Testing Team thru email.  Jenkins(Build Orchestration Tool)
						
			
			
			Continuous Integration :::	It is a capability of developers to continuously integrate the code for further testing.
						Promote the application for further testing (QA/UAT-Envi.) - Jenkins
									QA  -  Quality Assurance Testing
									UAT -  User Acceptance Testing
						Notify the Testing Team thru email.  Jenkins(Build Orchestration Tool)
					
					signin.java ==> 2500 lines of codes
						10 lines of changes 
			
			Continuous Testing
						QA  -  Quality Assurance Testing  --> TestNG/Selenium --> Jenkins 
			
			Continuous Delivery/ Deployment 
				==>  It is just a process of copying the application artifacts from lower environment to higher environment
								
				--> These are refered to Production Release.
				Continuous Delivery		===> It requires Manual approval for Prod. release
				
				Continuous Deployment	===> It is completely automated - No Approvals are needed to perform the prod release.
				
						Ansible/Jenkins/Docker/Kubernetes

			Non-Prod Environments									Production Environment
			
				Dev - code - build - unit testing 
				Test 
					QA 
					UAT 						======>					Prod_Environment
					
					
			Deployment Window :::: 
			
			Continuous Delivery :::
				Online Banking!!!! Prod Deployment Window --> 4 to 6 Hrs.
						If deployment is successful 
						If it failed????
							Try to fix the issue within the deployment window 
							If it is not possible to fix, then the changes will be reverted.
							
			Continuous Deployment :::
			
				Starting from Application Build, UT, Code promotion, QA, UAT, Prod Release ==> is completely Automated.
			amazon.com
			netflix 
			
			Continuous Monitoring
					
					-> Infra-Structure Monitoring - Jenkins
								Prometheus/Grafana/					
							
					-> Application Monitoring
								AppDynamics
			

			
			Software Application ::
			
				Mobile/Web/Desktop Applications
				
			Legacy applications architecture : 
					
					Monolith Application Architecture  :::
						
							The Application Components are tightly coupled.
							
					Micro-Service Based Application Architecture :::
					
							The Application is splitted into various services.
							It is loosely coupled.
							
			
			
			www.amazon.com - E_Commerce  ::::

			Developers's Perspective ::::
			
						sign_up ==> --> 3 - tier Architecture
										FrontEnd,Application_Logic,BackEnd(Database) SQL/ORACLE
						
			
			Sign_up			---> (Micro-service) Developer will make the code change --> test --> QA/UAT/ --> Released to Prod.

				--> Type of Programming Language 
				--> Tools used to develop the Application 
				--> Tools used to build the Application
				--> Tools used to perform Automated Testing 
			
			Worst Case of DevOps Engineer ?
			
				Challenges ??
				Drawback of DevOps  ???
				
			People! ==> are the main challenge!!!!
			
			DevOps is all about :	
					People 
					Process 	--> are meant for Continuous Improvement
					Tools		-->  
					
			Individual member of DevOps Team ::: 
					- Update yourself regularly.
					- Always find the scope for automation.					
					
					DevOps - DevSecops - SRE - GitOps - MLOps - AIOps .....
					
			Java_Appln ==> approached to onboard their appln to devops. 
			
				Automate --> CI/Cd/CD/CT/CM
				
			
			
			DevOps Engineer Role :::

				
				--> Type of Programming Language 
						Java --> How the java pgm is written
							
				--> Tools used to develop the Application

								Notepad to write the pgms ??
								compile 
								create binaries 

								build 
								test 
								deploy
								
							IDE - Integrated Developement Environment 
									Eclipse ???
									- to write java pgm?					==> Code Editor
									- compile program & create artifacts	==> Build Tool			javac *.java
									- run the pgm 							==> Hosted Servers(tomcat)/terminals java pgm1
			
							Build --> What type of build tool we use ?
							
									ant/gradle/maven 
									
							MAVEN is a build tool ==> used to compile and create artifacts (binaries - *.war/*.jar)
							
							
					Java --> is called as platform independent language
							
					Dev Environment --> I have create java application in windows.
					
						create once and run in any platform 
						
							Linux/Mac/Android/iOS
				
					JVM ==> 
					
					sample.java ==> 
					
					*.class files 
				
				Build Tool Maven
				
					Maven is build tool used to identify all the dependencies and plugins required
						- To perform Automated Build 
						- To perform Automated Unit Testing
						- Automatically create the artifacts 
						
						
					Install Maven in the build server 
					
						mvn == command we can execute maven build

		git commit		==> Used to commit the changes from staging area to Local Repository.
		git push		==> Used to publish/push the changes from local repository to Remote Repository.
		
		git fetch/pull	==> Both git fetch and pull are used to handle the incremental Changes from remote repository.
		
						==> git fetch is just used to check for any incremental changes in remote repository. If there is any changes exist, it will fetch the changes from remote repository into local repository. NOT working Directory.
							
						==> git pull is used to check for any incremental changes in remote repository. If there is any changes exist, 	it will fetch the changes from remote repository into local repository and update the changes in working Directory as well.
						
		git clone		==>	Used to clone/copy the entire remote git repository to local machine.
							This is always recommended to be the one time activity.
							
		fork			==> Used to copy a remote repository to another remote repository
						
	
		
		Create New Repository in Local Machine using GIT.	

		git init 		==> Used to initialize a new git repository in local machine.
							Create GIT_DIR and a default branch called master.
		
		git status		==> Used to track the status of git repository

		git config ==> Used to setup the default configuration for Author Name and Email ID.
		
			Local Configuration : 	applicable only for a specific repository

			==> It is used to undo the changes. 
			
		git reset :::
		
			- It is used to undo the changes for the repository.
			- It will never create any new commit commit point.
			- We should avoid using git reset in shared repository(remote repo.)
			
		
		git reset --soft 		==> This will undo the changes from repository by moving the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
									This is remove the changes from local repository, but the changes remains in staging area as well as in working directory.
			
		*git reset --mixed		==> This will undo the changes from repository by moving the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
									This is remove the changes from local repository as well as from staging area. But, the changes remains in working directory.			
			
		git reset --hard		==> This will undo the changes from repository by moving the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
									This is remove the changes from local repository, staging area as well as from the working directory.		
		


		git reset <commit_id>	==> This will use --mixed option by default.
				
		syntax :
				git reset <commit_id> <type>
				
				cm5				latest commit - HEAD

		git revert :::
		
			It is used to undo the changes.
			It is used to revert a specific commit.
			revert will create a new commit point.
			
			Without losing the track of changes we can revert.
			It is recommended in shared repositories.
			I want to safely undo the changes.
			Keeps the track of commits.

		git revert <commit_id>

		Branching Techniques :::
		
			It is used to perform parallel development.
			To maintain the integrity of master Branch.
			
		Enhancement Project :::
		
		Existing Repository ==> default branch called master/main (Production copy)

				git Merge :::		Used to merge the changes from the current branch to target branch
				
						git merge <branch_name>		# this branch name should you the current branch
						
						git merge feature1 			# Execute the git Merge Command from the target branch.
						
							git switch master 
							
							git merge feature
							
				master

				MERGE Conflict :::
				
					Occurs when we try to merge the changes from multiple branches into the same target branch,file and same record. 
					
					
				RESOLVE Merge Conflict :::
				
					How to resolve Merge Conflict ???
					
						1. Identify the file that is causing merge conflict.
						2. Review the file content.
						3. Decide which Record / who's changes has to be maintained.
						4. Make necessary changes in the file.
						5. Add and Commit the Latest Changes.
						
						
				Prevent the Merge Conflict :::
				
					How to prevent the Merge Conflict ???
							
							Before Merge, do a detailed review of the changes.
							With proper approval.
							
							
					GIT Commands :::
					
							git rebase 
							git squash

				Terminologies :::
				
					Containerization :
						It is the process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.
					
					Namespace (NS)			--> Used to create independent process to the containers
					Control Groups (CG)		--> Used to create the level of isolation to run the containers in the namespace.
					
					Container Engine 		--> Used to create the container Images, Run the Container, Manage the Container resources.
												It acts as an interface between the underlying OS and the Containers.
					Image					--> Images are the static file, that defines the application and its depedencies.
												Image are Non-Executable.
					Container				--> Containers are Executable unit of Image. 
					Container Registry		--> It is used to Store and Manage the Container Images.
												dockerhub - is the default container registry for Container Images.
												www.hub.docker.com
					Container Repository	--> These are the subset of Container Registry.
					
					
				About Container Registry 
				
				Installation of Container Engine.  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

		Working with Docker 
		
		overview od DockerHub 
		
		
		
		Using Docker Engine, we are gng to create containers 
		
			use the exist images docker hub and create containers 
			Build the user defined/application Image and create the containers.
		
		
		Containerization ::
				- OS level Virtualization
				- Used to run the applications. NOT an Operating System.
				- It is light-weight when compared to VMs.
				- It consume less volume and faster.
				- Each Container run in its own address space, and it is completely isolated from other containers and base OS.
				- It uses the underlying properties of base OS.
					like Namespaces & Control Groups.	

			
			
			docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
			
			docker pull images
			
			docker run centos 
			
			docker run ubuntu
			
			docker run --name=mycontainer1 centos
			
			Container Modes of Execution :::
			
				- Foreground mode / attached mode* (That Terminal will be locked by that container, till the container goes to exit state.
						docker run centos sleep 20
					
				- Background mode / detached mode 
						docker run -d centos sleep 20 
						
				- Interactive Mode
						docker run -it centos		### This will allow to login to container while it is running.
					
			
			Stop the container 
			
			remove the images and container
			
				docker rmi <image_name>
				
				docker rmi -f <imagename>
				
				docker rm <container_id>
				
				
			
			Start and Stop the container ::
			
				docker start <container_id>
				
				docker stop <container_id>
				
			Container Port Mapping/Binding  :::
			
				<external_IP_Addr>:8080		# Accessed the tomcat running in VM.
				
			Port Mapping ==> It is process of mapping the container port with the host port.
			
			docker run -it -p 8085:8080 tomcat:8.0
			
			
				-p <host_port>:<container_port>
				
				
			QA_Server :::
						*.war
						tomcat ==> *.war - 8080
						100 application artifacts (micro-services)
						
						C1 - tomcat appln. 8080
						C2 - tomcat appln. 8081 ..... C100
						
				docker logs <continer_id> 
				
				docker inspect <continer_id>
				
			Container Volumes ::::
			
				Containers are not a permanent entity.
				
				
				Application :::
				
					- Stateless Application 
							The application will not have any trace of execution.
					
					- Stateful Application
							The Applications/service will have the trace of execution in the form of logs/reports/artifacts
							
			Container Volumes are used to run any stateful Application and maintain persistant volumes to permanently store the data generated by the application inside the container.
			
			docker volume list
			
			docker volume create sadevopsvol 
			
			docker volume inspect sadevopsvol
			
			docker run -it --mount source=sadevopsvol,destination=/sadevopsvol centos
			
			To send any input files to container or to access teh output files from container, we use container volume.
			
			
			3-tier application architecture ::::
			
				Micro-Service based architecture :::
				
					sign_in  --> Service (Front End,Application_Logic,BackEnd_DB)	
						
									Service (C1,C2,C3)				
					
			To run multiple containers as a single service we use Docker Compose.

Architecture of Kubernetes
				
	Master Components :::::

	Below are the main components on the Kubernetes master node:

		etcd cluster – a simple, distributed key value storage which is used to store the Kubernetes cluster data (such as number of pods, their state, namespace, etc), API objects and service discovery details. It is only accessible from the API server for security reasons. 

		kube-apiserver – Kubernetes API server is the central management entity that receives all REST requests for modifications (to pods, services, replication sets/controllers and others), serving as frontend to the cluster. 
		Also, this is the only component that communicates with the etcd cluster, making sure data is stored in etcd and agrees with the service details of the deployed pods.

		kube-controller-manager – runs several distinct controller processes in the background (for example, replication controller controls number of replicas in a pod, endpoints controller populates endpoint objects like services and pods, and others) to regulate the shared state of the cluster and perform routine tasks. 

		cloud-controller-manager – is responsible for managing controller processes with dependencies on the underlying cloud provider (if applicable). For example, when a controller needs to check if a node was terminated or set up routes, load balancers or volumes in the cloud infrastructure, all that is handled by the cloud-controller-manager.

		kube-scheduler – helps schedule the pods (a co-located group of containers inside which our application processes are running) on the various nodes based on resource utilization. It reads the service’s operational requirements and schedules it on the best fit node. 


	Node (worker) components  :::::

	Below are the main components found on a (worker) node:

		kubelet – the main service on a node, regularly taking in new or modified pod specifications (primarily through the kube-apiserver) and ensuring that pods and their containers are healthy and running in the desired state. This component also reports to the master on the health of the host where it is running.

		kube-proxy – a proxy service that runs on each worker node to deal with individual host subnetting and expose services to the external world. It performs request forwarding to the correct pods/containers across the various isolated networks in a cluster.

			Infra-Structure as Code :::
			
			dev namespace ==> only dev team 
			
			qa_ namespace ==> only testing
			
			
			Infra-Structure as Code :::
			
				DevOps :::
				
					Infra-Structure Provisioning and Configurations 
					
						Worker_Machine 
							Configure all the required tools.
							
							
				Infra-Structure Team :::
				
				Dev_Team :: 100 Developers 
						Dev_machine 
						Install all the required tools & Service
						
				Automate the Server Creation ???
				
					CLI/Shell scripts 
					
					IAC Tools ::
						Terraform / Cloudformation ==> Provision the Servers.
				
				Automate the Server Configuration ???
						
						Ansible 	==> Configure the server
						
				Ansible is IAC Tool used for Configuration Management.
					It is simple and Agentless
					It is powerful IAC Tool
					It uses push mechanism to manage the target machines.
				
				
				Ansible is used to :
					- Configure the Server - Installation/Unstallation/Upgrade of tools/Services
					- Deployment of Applications 
					- Used to perform Security Patch updates in all the target Machines
					
				Ansible Architecture :::				
					Client/Server Architecture:
					
					
				Ansible Controller/Master/Engine :::
				
					Inventory 
					Modules 
					ansible.cfg
					
					Inventory: 
						It is just a flat file used to maintain the target server details.
						-IP of Target Machines 
						-SSH_User_Name
						-SSH_Password
						-Connection_type
						
					Modules :
						It is the script used to perform any task in the target machines.
						shell ==> used to run shell commands in target machine 
						yum/apt/dnf
						These modules are injected into the target server and it gets executed in target server.
						Once the execution is completed, the script will be removed from target machine.					
					
					ansible.cfg	==> This defines the default properties of Ansible controller Machines.
				
				Connection is established using SSH.
				
				How to execute the Modules ::::
				
					- Ansible Adhoc Commands 
					
						apt install git -y
					
					- Ansible Playbooks 
						-> Manifest file that defines the set/series of tasks to be executed in target machines.
						-> Thest manifest files are written using *.yaml script
						
						update 
						jdk
						install tomcat 
						start tomcat
						
						Build Server 
						
							git 
							jdk 
							maven 
						
						
				Install Ansible ::
				
					
					Prepare the Ansible Controller Machine :::
							Python is a pre-requisites
							Install Ansible
							Create valid user & SSH Key
					
					Prepare the Ansible Target Machines :::
							Valid User Name.
							
				
				3 VM : 
					1- Ansible Controller 
					2- Ansible Target
					
					
			Working with Ansible Adhoc Commands ::::
			
				ansible <host> -m <module_name> -i <inventory_file>
				
				Possible values for <host> : group_name/node_name/all
				Eg.: 
				
				ansible testnodes -m ping

   15  cd /etc/ansible/
   16  ls
   17  cat hosts
   18  clear
   19  ls
   20  vi hosts
   21  ll
   22  chown -R devopsadmin:devopsadmin /etc/ansible
   23  clear
   24  exit
   25  ls
   26  cd /etc/ansible/
   27  ls
   28  clear
   29  ansible testnodes -m ping
   30  ansible samplenode1 -m ping
   31  ansible samplenode2 -m ping
   32  ansible all -m ping
   33  ls
   34  cd ..
   35  cd ~
   36  ansible all -m ping
   37  pwd
   38  cd /etc/ansible/
   39  ls
   40  cat ansible.cfg
   41  ls
   42  clear
   43  ls
   44  ll
   45  cat ansible.cfg
   46  clear
   47  ls
   48  vi devmachines
   49  vi devmachines
   50  ansible devnodes -m ping
   51  ansible devnodes -m ping -i devmachines
   52  ansible devnode1 -m ping -i devmachines

		Ansible Adhoc Commands ::::
		
			ansible testnodes -m ping 
			
			
		Ansible Playbooks :::
		
			It is written in *.yaml
			
		Playbook :
			It is used to execute the series of tasks.
			Task is just the collection of modules.
			
			Playbook should be organised and it should reusable.
			
		Create a simple playbook  to execute a module.
		
			debug module is used to display the content to the terminal
			
			
		Using user-defined variables in Playbook :::
		
		
		Ansible Roles :
		
				Organise the ansible components(variables, handlers, default, properties, tasks)
				Re-use the ansible Components
				Share the Ansible Components 
		
			- Install Pre-requisites 
			- Install the actual tool
